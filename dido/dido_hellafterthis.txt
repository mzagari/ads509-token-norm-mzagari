"Hell After This" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Hell After This"
Get a room
Fall in love
Just for an afternoon
Lovin' goes too slow
Light moves alone
A song that plays
Makes me miss
All that I've lost
Till the sun goes down
And the lights go on
This feeling I'm fine
Gone when you're gone
Hell after this
Is gone when I'm home
If I'm going to hell
After this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I won't remember your face
After this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
Got a coin and a sun
Back in time
Looking up
Got the sky on my mind
Out at sea, get a drink
It's time for a change
Feels like god is on my side
This feeling I'm fine
Gone when you're gone
Hell after this
Is gone when I'm home
If I'm going to hell
After this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I won't remember your face
After this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
If I'm going to hell
After this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
