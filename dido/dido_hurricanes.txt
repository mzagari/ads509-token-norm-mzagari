"Hurricanes" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Hurricanes"
I wanna wake up
With your weight by my side
And I wanna think that
You look good as you rise
And I wanna turn to you
Turn around by your side
And I wanna think
But not to say
Let me face
The sound and fury
Let me face
Hurricanes
And I wanna see you
As you walk through the door
And time will make us
Some ways less and some ways more
And I wanna talk of nothing
As the world passes by
And I wanna think
But not to say
Let me face
The sound and fury
Let me face
Hurricanes
Let me not turn away
From happiness or pain
Just not to run away
In my heart and in my head
Let me face
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Let me face
The sound and fury
Let me face
Hurricanes
Let me face
The sound and fury
Let me face
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
