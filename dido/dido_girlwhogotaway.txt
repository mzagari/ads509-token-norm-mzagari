"Girl Who Got Away" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Girl Who Got Away"
I wanna move with the seasons
And go with the flow
And take it easy
And let stuff go
I wanna sleep like a baby
Rise with the sun
And kick it all back
And get nothing done
I wanna make this day
The longest day
With a warmth that
Delivers happiness
If only for today
I wanna be
The girl who got away
The lover who really loved
The dancer who danced
To the last song
Don't wanna take sides
Don't wanna make sense
Of pounds and pence
I want to be alone
I don't wanna hide
Don't wanna be talked over
Or walked upon
I wanna think the heart
Is bigger than the head
Wanna follow you
But not be led
If only for today
I wanna be
The girl who got away
The lover who really loved
The dancer who danced
To the last song
I know what it's like
To be passed over
To go unnoticed
To be clumsy get things wrong
And I know what it's like
To arrive too late
To be told to leave
To be walked upon
If only for today
I wanna be
The girl who got away
The lover who really loved
The dancer who danced
To the last song
