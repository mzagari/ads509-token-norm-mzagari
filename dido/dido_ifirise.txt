"If I Rise" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"If I Rise"
(with A. R. Rahman)
(from "127 Hours" soundtrack)
[Dido:]
In your life, you're mad
In your car, you're sad
O' your taller now I've found
Hold your fire course
O' your fallen out
Go and sow your courses
[A R R:]
If I rise, evermore try
If I believe, there is more than this
There is more than this
[Dido:]
If I rise, one more try
All I give, more than this
O' your taller now I've found
Hold your fire course
O' your fallen out
Go and sow your courses
[A R R:]
If I rise, evermore try
If I believe, there is more than this
There is more than this
[Chorus:]
If I found I wanted more
That though I've wandered far from home
I'd never lost the way back again
Back again
[A R R & Dido:]
If I rise, evermore try
If I believe, there is more than this
There is more than this
[Chorus:]
If I found I wanted more
That though I've wandered far from home
If I found I wanted more
That though I've wandered far from home
[Dido:]
If I believe, there's more than this
Even more than this
