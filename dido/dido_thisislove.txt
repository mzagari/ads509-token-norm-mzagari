"This Is Love" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"This Is Love"
Well, it's done and now, now we can walk away
Take the love and leave the rest behind
Hey love, hey love, we don't need anything
Now it's just me and you and more than I deserve
Oh, what a day!
Oh, this is love!
Oh, what a life!
Oh, this is love!
There is unknown, there is loss and there is pain as well
We are proof that you can win it all
We are safe, we are free, don't wanna change a thing
And God, I feel thankful for all you brings in me
Oh, what a day!
Oh, this is love!
Oh, what a life!
Oh, this is love!
Oh, what a day!
Oh, this is love!
Oh, what a life!
Oh, this is love!
Oh, this is love!
Oh, this is love!
