Dido Lyrics
"Let's Do The Things We Normally Do"
Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrow
And I'll try for you to be a little more on time
I know you need to say you know you've let me down
But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around
Please don't say how proud you are
Lets do the things we normally do
I'll say see you later
You'll sing a line or two
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to
Lets forget that we're here and make some plans
We'll go for walks
Sit on the bench we always sat
I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you
Don't try to stay awake
I'm feeling tired too
This is just another day
Let's do the things we normally do
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to
Armored cars and tanks and guns came to take away our sons
And everybody's stood behind
The man behind the wire
There's a fight to love
A fight to have
Your bed's a battlefield and back
And all of this will just be stripped away
Let's do the things we normally do
I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to
Don't look me in the eye more than you need to
Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to
Don't say how proud you are
And say I'm far away
and take along your
and say a word
and I can say fade away
