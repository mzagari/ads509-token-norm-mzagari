"Sitting On The Roof Of The World" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Sitting On The Roof Of The World"
I climbed a mountain
Not knowing that I had
Thought it was just a road from a to b
I took no protection
Not much of anything
Just went as I was
Looking in windows
And playing songs
And knocking on doors
I was not scared
I just enjoyed the sights
Kept myself to myself
There I was
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was
There I was
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave
Everyone says I was lucky to have got there
As not many can
But truth be told I was saved
By the love
Of a good man
Who came and got me
And brought me down
From on up there
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I missed it now and then
But I have no wish to go back there
There I was
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was
With all the gods
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave
People say
What's so special about being back here
With everyone so close
But that's the point
I don't want to be different
I just want to fit in
There I was
There I was
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was
With all the gods
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave
