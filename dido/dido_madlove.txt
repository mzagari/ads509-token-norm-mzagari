"Mad Love" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Mad Love"
Let 'em tell us stories
As we lie in the fields
And watch the birds soar above
Let 'em tell us of love and loss
How we'll live and how we'll die
Cos they say he once was
Somebody with a black suit
And good shoes
And a perfect smile
Who makes me want to ask
Was it in the mad loves
And the big fights
So was it in a small change
And the passing of day
So was it in the giving up
And the getting on
Oh, was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
And the big fights
Let 'em tell us stories
As we lie in the fields
And watch the clouds pass above
How paper burns and pictures fade
Only melody remains
And sure enough he laughs as if he knows
Makes me want to ask
Was it in the mad loves
And the big fights
So was it in the right words
At the right times
Was it in the giving up
And the moving on
Oh, was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the little things
We all want
We all want
We all want
Was it in the mad loves
And the big fights
So was it in the small change
And the passing of day
So was it in the giving up
And the getting on
Oh, was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad love
And the big fights
