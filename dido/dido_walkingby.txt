"Walking By" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Walking By"
Keep me locked up, keep me shut in
You can but my mind still roams free
You can keep me caged
You can tell me to be quiet
But I remember everything
Please don't forget that you broke your own heart
And don't forget that you lost your mind
Please stop telling everybody that I did it for you
Cos every step I take I'm always here without you
And I don't need words or anything from you
And I wish I never felt it
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never met you
Kept on walking by
Keep me locked up, keep me shut in
But I remember everything
Please don't forget that you sold your own heart
And don't forget that you lost your way
Please stop telling everybody that I did it for you
Cos every step I take I'm always here behind you
And I don't need words or anything from you
And I wish I never seen it
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never met you
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never tried it
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never felt it
Please stop telling everybody that I did it for you
Cos every step I take I'm always here without you
And I don't need words or anything from you
And I wish I never met you
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never felt it
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never seen it
Kept on walking by
And I wish I never met you
Kept on walking by
