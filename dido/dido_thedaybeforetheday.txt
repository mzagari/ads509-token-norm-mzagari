"The Day Before The Day" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"The Day Before The Day"
Speeches won't be made today, clocks will carry on
Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black, babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
But we know that you are gone
You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
It wakes me every single night, thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time have doubts at any stage
Were you calm or were you numb or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret until today
You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time, that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today
You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same
That was until the day before the day
