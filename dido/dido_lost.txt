"Lost" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Lost"
However long I'm under makes no difference
However long I'm down there'll be air for me
All I've had that's lost, that's gone it falls away
And I'll come up in my time, there'll be no fear for me
I walk down this easy path where shadows fall behind
And rest beneath the trees and wait for me
Lost's where I belong, lost's where I've gone
Lost is my new home, lost's where I belong
Usually darkness gets to me, this place is mine
No idea what led me to more peace than home
Dressed in blue she takes me through, no doubt for me
To follow right behind the sun is blind and I can't see
Lost's where I belong, lost's where I've gone
Lost is my new home, lost's where I belong
Lost's where I belong, lost where I've gone
Lost is my new home, lost's where I belong
I can walk, with no end, nothing hurts, nothing's pain
Nothing's missed, no one's gone, moved away, nothing's wrong.
Lost where I belong, lost where I've gone
Lost is where I belong
