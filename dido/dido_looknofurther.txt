"Look No Further" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Look No Further"
I might have been a singer
Who sailed around the world?
A gambler who wins millions
And spent it all on girls
I might have been a poet
Who walked upon the moon?
A scientist who would tell the world
I discovered something new
I might have loved a king
Been the one to end a war
A criminal who drink Champaign
And never could be caught
But among your books
Among your clothes
Among the noise and fuss
I've let it go
I can't stop and catch my breathe
And Look No further for happiness
And I will not turn again
'Cause my heart has found its home
Everyone I'll never meet
And friends I won't now make
The adventures that they could have been
And the risks I'll never take
But Among Your Books
Among your clothes
Among the noise and fuss
I've let it go
I can't stop and catch my breathe
And Look No further for happiness
And I will not turn again
'Cause my heart has found its home
