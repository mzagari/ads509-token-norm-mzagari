"Friends" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Friends"
I know you thought I'd never be
Really much of anything
While you were telling me
I turned against the wind
When my eyes started to burn
And you turned your back on me
Well you see I slipped away
Now turn to me
Cos I've done a hundred things
You've only dreamed
So don't come crying to me
Don't come trying again
No matter how I feel, don't call us friends
Cos I don't remember anymore how we used to be
No, I don't remember anymore how I used to feel
Don't call us friends
And you waited all alone
For your luck to come along
You assumed that things they'd go your way
It would all just carry on
Well you see it slipped away
Now turn to me
Cos I've done a hundred things
You've only dreamed
So don't come crying to me
Don't come trying again
No matter how I feel, don't call us friends
Cos I don't remember anymore how we used to be
No, I don't remember anymore how I used to feel
Don't call us
So don't come crying to me
Don't come trying again
No matter how I feel, don't call us friends
Cos I don't remember anymore how we used to be
No, I don't remember anymore how I used to feel
Don't call us friends
