"Summer" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Summer"
We can make it rain again
I'd feel like I belong
Let's make it cold again
I'm not ready and it's wrong
We can put the outdoor chairs back in and lock the door
Go back to walking all heads down and put our coats back on
The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you
We can stay at home and draw the blinds and light a fire
Pull the covers high and go to sleep early for hours
Don't want to be too hot and there's no way to cool down
Don't want to sit outside all night or even leave the house
The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you
I don't want to sit and drink in parks and watch the sun go down
Don't want to put my feet in water and lie back in the grass
I don't want to watch the plains go by or hold anybody's hand
The summer's come too soon and I can't come back to you
The summer's come too soon and I'm still missing you
And if the sun would go down
Stop reminding us how
If we ever had a chance
I don't by now
