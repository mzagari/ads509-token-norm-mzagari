"Loveless Hearts" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Loveless Hearts"
I can find the good news in anything
But without you, that's all gone
No one could have told me how much I'd miss you
And how soon the world moves on
How can they not hear me
When I say
Oh, we're not safe anymore
Did loveless hearts build the world
Only to tear it apart
How did those gods tempt you to leave
Just when we needed you most
The sun will rise today as it did yesterday
And I'll keep on going too
But every hour that I get through it breaks my heart
That I am losing more of you
Did loveless hearts build the world
Only to tear it apart
How did those gods tempt you to leave
Just when we needed you most
[x2]
