"My Lover's Gone" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"My Lover's Gone"
My lover's gone
his boots no longer by my door
he left at dawn
and as I slept I felt him go
Returns no more
I will not watch the ocean
My lover's gone
no earthly ships will ever bring him home again
bring him home again
My lover's gone
I know that kiss will be my last
no more his song
the tune upon his lips has passed
I sing alone
while I watch the ocean
My lover's gone
no earthly ships will ever bring him home again
bring him home again
