"Those Were The Days" lyrics
R Plus & Dido Lyrics
"Those Were The Days"
We were kids
We'd know it all
We will live
We will love forever more
We were blind
So we were free
We had no care
Just doubts
We were young
Love as a weapon
Days so sharp
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough (We were kids)
Never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough (We were friends)
Never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough (We were young)
Never enough, never enough
It's never enough, never enough (We were kids)
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough (We were friends)
Never enough, never enough
Never enough
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days (Never enough)
Those were the days (Never enough, never enough)
Those were the days (Never enough, never enough)
Those were the days (Never enough)
Those were the days
Those were the days (Never enough)
Those were the days (Never enough, never enough)
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Never enough, never enough
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
Those were the days
