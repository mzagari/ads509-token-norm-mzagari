"Love To Blame" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Love To Blame"
Helen of Troy was the kind of girl
Who really had it all
Not a care in the world but her head was turned
And forever changed
She said one love is lost but another is found
So just take the keys and let's just go, birds fly south
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It's all about love
So I'm not to blame
I'm not to blame
She said I've dotted my i's and I've crossed my t's
Had time for friends when they needed me
I try to make sense of senseless things
Try to live how I believe
And of course I leave things behind that I'll regret
But there's time enough for new things yet, for new things yet
When the dust covers the sun
And all you hope for is undone
Will you turn and say
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It was all for love so love is to blame
Love is to blame
[x7]
When the dust covers the sun
And all you hope for is undone
Will you turn and say
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It was all for love so love is to blame
Love is to blame
[x2]
Love is to blame
[x6]
