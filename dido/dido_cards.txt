"Cards" lyrics
R Plus & Dido Lyrics
"Cards"
Oh, baby, baby, baby
What happened to those days
When the doors were always open
And the music always played?
Do you remember, darling
All the words we never said?
I loved you then
I loved you still
I loved you then
I loved you still
But the cards didn't fall that way
But the cards didn't fall that way
Oh, baby, baby, baby
What happened to those days
When the world was laid before us?
Our plans we never made
I heard you came a-callin'
To see if I was still around
I loved you then
I loved you still
I loved you then
I loved you still
I loved you then
I loved you still
I loved you then
I loved you still
I loved you then
I loved you then
I loved you then
I loved you then
I loved you then
But the cards never fell that way
But the cards never fell that way
But the cards never fell that way
