"This Land Is Mine" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"This Land Is Mine"
From behind these walls I hear your song
Oh, sweet words
The music that you play lights up my world
The sweetest that Iâve heard
Could it be that Iâve been touched and turned
Oh Lord, please finallyâ¦finally things are changing
[Chorus:]
This land is mine but Iâll let you rule
I let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you knowâ¦this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
Ohhh, Iâm ready to let you in
Just as long as we knowâ¦this land is mine
After all the battles and the wars
The scars and loss
Iâm still the queen of my domain
and feeling stronger now
The walls are down a little more each day
Since you came, finallyâ¦finally things are changing
[Chorus]
Follow the days Iâve travelled alone
In this cold and colorless place till now
Itâs what I had to pay
[Chorus]
This land is mine and I let you rule
I let you navigate on demand
Just as long as you knowâ¦this land is mine
