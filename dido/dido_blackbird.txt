"Blackbird" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Blackbird"
He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up
He added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that
He took his coat from the hook and his scarf and his hat
And he put down a key and said I won't be needing that
And he turned and smiled as if that explained it all
And he walked down the hall and he opened the door
And said of course I'll call
Heart, why do I bring you love
When all you give me back is pain?
Heart, why do we search it out
To watch you wash your hands and walk away?
Now there's a black black blackbird in my chest
All a flutter, and all caged in
Wanting to break free with the wolves in my head
Who tear at every wise thing I should have said
Heart, why do I bring you love
When all you give me back is pain?
Heart, why do we search it out
To watch you wash your hands and walk away?
We're not the strangers we were
When we first met
But the kind of strangers at the end
And all that remains is a day without plans
Where I won't be missed, another handful of sand
Heart, why do I bring you love
When all you give me back is pain?
Heart, why do we search it out
To watch you wash your hands and walk away?
