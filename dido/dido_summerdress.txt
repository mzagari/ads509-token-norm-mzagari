"Summer Dress" lyrics
R Plus & Dido Lyrics
"Summer Dress"
Was it the dress I was wearing?
Or getting lost going home?
Was it the summer stars shining?
Or the laughter we shared?
Was it the dress I was wearing? (Was it the dress I was wearing?)
Or getting lost going home? (Or getting lost going home?)
Was it the summer stars shining? (Was it the summer stars shining?)
Or the laughter we shared? (Or the laughter we shared?)
Was it the dress I was wearing? (Was it the dress I was wearing?)
Or getting lost going home? (Or getting lost going home?)
Was it the dress I was wearing? (Was it the summer stars shining?)
Or getting lost going home? (Or the laughter we shared?)
Like love now arriving
In the palm of my hand
Boy, he was fine
Boy, he was fine
Boy, he was fine
Boy, he was fine
Boy, he was fine
Boy, he was fine
Boy, he was fine
