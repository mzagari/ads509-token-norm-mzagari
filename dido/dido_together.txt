"Together" lyrics
R Plus & Dido Lyrics
"Together"
Ladies and gentlemen
We have begun
We don't need the news
Just need the weather
We can tell the time
We'd prefer getting better
We're like the night before
We'll love the morning after
We spend time alone
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We don't need the news
Just need the weather
We can tell the time
We'd prefer getting better
We're like the night before
We'll love the morning after
We spend time alone
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
We live together
We fit together
We fit together
We fit together
