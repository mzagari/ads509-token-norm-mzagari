"Teacher's Poem"
All time came calling
In this one moment
All the past
And all the present
It swooped
Like a swallow
Through the open car window
It came from the sun
That sat between the mountains
Blazing down
Upon the pines
It flew, a blur
Up the winding road
Faster than I could drive
It rushed through the forest
Over the dry red earth
In and out of the thin grey trees
(Many freshly burnt)
Both future and history
It could be forever
Though it was only
The 10-minute journey
Between Forada
And Buscatell
