"You Don't Need A God" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"You Don't Need A God"
I can hear the music
Just a few notes from a passing car
And they can take me
With heart opening speed
To somewhere not here
I'm hell stuck still by a side of something
Nothing much to see
But enough to catch me
Send me absolutely elsewhere
Take me absolutely right here
You don't need a god
To pray I'm here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't need a thing
While we have
Right here
It can be one word
Or the smallest thing that only I see
It's like lightning
And it changed the way I feel
And sends me absolutely elsewhere
And holds me absolutely right here
You don't need a god
To pray I'm here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't need a thing
While we have
Right here
You don't need a god
To pray I'm here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't need a thing
While we have
Right here
Right here
Right here
