"Just Because" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Just Because"
Sing your song
Just sing your song
Just sing your song
Just sing your song
Hello, hello
You're taking a chance, ya know
And you can say you tried
Just because
If you get it wrong just laugh it off
You don't need to hide in the dark
We know, we know
It won't last
Sing your song
Just sing your song
(Just because everybody does it)
Sing your song
(Doesn't mean that we need to)
(Just because everybody wants it)
Just sing your song
(Doesn't mean we want it too)
Just because everybody does it
Doesn't mean that we need to
Just because everybody wants it
Doesn't mean we want it too
Just because everybody's talking
We don't need to share
Just because
Is not enough
We are, we are
And whether we say we are
We are what we try to do
We'll be what we want to be
We are, we are
And whether we say we are
We are what we try to do
We'll do what we want to do
You're the sun, you're the sun, you're the sun
Happy out there alone
You don't need to hear it all
You don't need to see it all
Just sing your song
Just sing your song
