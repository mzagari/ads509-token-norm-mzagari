Dido Lyrics
"All I See"
(feat. Pete Miser)
I thought it was done when I packed my bags and walked into the light
I picked the books I thought I should and closed the door behind
And when I handed back the keys I thought that I was free
No shame, no dirt, no surprises wait for me
I want to believe that where I began is not where I'll always be
But you're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me
Thought it was safe to assume once I locked up the room
That I'd be gone for good but I would be back soon
Memories burned out still I'm smelling the fumes
Melodies turned down still I'm singing the tunes
Like a witch on a broom I wish I could fly fly away
Disappear into the ether find a hideaway
But the memories invade when I lie awake
Can't hide from yourself is what I'm trying to say
And by the way what would I be without my past
Only find the right number when I doubt my math
Avoid blunders only after I recount my last
Setbacks that don't kill me just amount to laughs
Anyway if I could turn back the hands of time
Would I change the events or change my mind
Wouldn't recognise myself without my doubts and fears
Got a feeling all I need is all right here
And you're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me
I've been told apples don't fall far from the tree
I hope they're wrong when they're talking about me
All I see are the ruins of a plan gone wrong
All I need is a reason to keep on and stay strong
Gotta couple old ghosts that won't leave me alone
Even after moving three thousand miles from home
Thought I shook 'em when I hit Brooklyn wasn't even looking
But they're putting their mark on everything I do
Find a few quiet moments and they creep back through
Infiltrated my dreams and held my sleep back too
I don't know where I could go without them following me
It seems everywhere I look they're all I see
You're all I need
You're all I need
And you're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me
