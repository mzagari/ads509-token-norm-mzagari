"Us 2 Little Gods" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Us 2 Little Gods"
Walking home, burnt and red
"Sticky thin" he said
Let us go down in the woods
"Can you be careful?" she said
Us 2 little gods with the world at our feet
"Sticky thin, how you've grown?" They said
"You'll never fit in your long white dress
When's he going to try and get a job?"
"I'm thankful for what we've got" She said
Us 2 little gods with the world at our feet
Just in this life, I need no other
Just this day, I need no more
Just this moment, let it all stop here
Let it all stop here I've had my fill.
"Summers here, early again
Let's take the kid and go and celebrate
Drinking beer, moon on the left
And there's the sun, hold my hand" He said
Us 3 little gods, with the world at our feet
Just in this life, I need no other
Just this day, I need no more
Just this moment, let it all stop here
Let it all stop here I've had my fill.
