"Go Dreaming" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Go Dreaming"
Another summer coming to an end
And I'm still walking on without a care
And even if the birds have flown, the sun has gone
I'll still be here, here
Oh, I want to walk with kings
Oh, and take a chance on things
And though I may give way to those who could cause me pain
And step aside to threats and bullies
I still believe, I still believe
I'd rather go dreaming, believing in something, better than in me
I'd rather die loving, lost in the feeling of letting go
I'd rather die caring, working for something, seeing it as good
I can let it go, I can let it go
They're all flying flags and making noise
Bringing on their speeches drinks and boys
But when they're gone I'll be standing here
And picking up the mess they left
I still believe, I still believe
I'd rather go dreaming, believing in something, better than in me
I'd rather die loving, lost in the feeling of letting go
I'd rather die caring, working for something, seeing it as good
I can let it go, I can let it go...
