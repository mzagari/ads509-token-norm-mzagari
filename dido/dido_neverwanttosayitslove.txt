"Never Want To Say It's Love" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Never Want To Say It's Love"
I could put it down to being tired,
Or coming home to an empty house,
A passing moment,
A little man -
No one around to stop me writing to you.
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
I could apologize,
And say 'tear it up,
And put it down to the pills I've taken'
Seeing my friends with their lives moved on
Well I've been gently drifting
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
I felt the same today
As I was feeling yesterday
It'll be the same tomorrow
From an only one change
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
My home is home
And I'm settled now
I've made it through the restless phase
I have no reason to get bored anymore
My friends are around and your name comes up
Asking if I ever heard from you
I'm keeping it quiet about those words to you
But I meant every word that I said
I stand by every word that I said
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
I felt the same today
As I was feeling yesterday
It'll be the same tomorrow
From an only one change
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
I felt the same today
As I was feeling yesterday
It'll be the same tomorrow
From an only one change
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
