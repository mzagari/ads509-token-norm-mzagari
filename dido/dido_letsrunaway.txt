"Let's Run Away" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Let's Run Away"
And before I start the day
I have a glimpse of how I used to feel
When we drove all night and laughed all day
Thinking nothing can go wrong
And now our hands are full and walking in the dark
I don't know what's below or what's above
But it doesn't matter now
Don't look back
Don't look back
Let's runaway
Then tomorrow won't be the same
Let's go away
Then today won't feel the same
Don't look up and don't look left or right
Trust me now and we'll be fine
I'll take your fear and send it out to sea
And you'll forget every little thing you've seen
And it doesn't matter now
Don't look back
Let's runaway
Then tomorrow won't be the same
Let's go away
Then today won't feel the same
Let's runaway
Then tomorrow won't be the same
Let's go away
Then today won't feel the same
Let's runaway
Then tomorrow won't feel the same
Won't feel the same
