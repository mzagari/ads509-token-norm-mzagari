"What Am I Doing Here" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"What Am I Doing Here"
There's an empty seat next to me everywhere I go
Even on the plane and on the sofa back at home
Life's too short for all this time
We could have spent as two
I've seen it and I've held it
And it's better spent with you
I have run from most things that come too close
But all those journeys led me here, to your home
Now dated plans keep taking me further from you
Time is running out and I'm tired of missing you
What am I doing here when you're there?
What am I doing here when you're there?
I hope that they don't find me in many years to come
With a list of things by my bed that I've never done
One of them being coming back, travelling back to you
One of them being throwing off all these silly rules
Now dated plans keep taking me further from you
Time is running out and I'm tired of missing you
What am I doing here when you're there?
What am I doing here when you're there?
And I know that you're waiting for me
I know that you're waiting
I know that you're waiting
I know that you're waiting for me
So what am I doing here
When you're there?
What am I doing here when you're there?
And I know that you're waiting for me
I know that you're waiting
I know that you're waiting
I know that you're waiting for me
So what am I doing here?
