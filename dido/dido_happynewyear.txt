"Happy New Year" lyrics
Dido Lyrics
"Happy New Year"
I'll wear the jewels you gave me round my neck tonight
Though I know you won't be there
I'll wear them in a gold chain that catches in the light
Though I know of course you won't appear
I'll leave the party early after a drink or two
And I'll check my phone for calls
Though I know there will be none from you, from you
I'll walk home with snow falling
Deep on frozen lawns
And I'll leave all those others celebrating
All the things that they have done
I'll come over to your office and watch them come and go
Though I know I won't see you there
And I'll take a train down to the coast and sit and watch the sea
I'll be sitting there alone
As usual, above all things I miss you every day
Without pause
Happy new year my darling, happy new year
I'll walk home with snow falling
Deep on frozen lawns
And I'll leave all those others celebrating
All the things that they have done
Happy new year my darling, happy new year
(And I'll leave)
Happy new year my darling, happy new year
(And I'll leave)
Happy new year my darling, happy new year
(And I'll leave)
Happy new year my darling, happy new year
(And I'll leave...)
