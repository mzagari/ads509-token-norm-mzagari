"Clouds Like Islands" lyrics
R Plus Lyrics
"Clouds Like Islands"
Pine forests, clouds like islands
Spanish boys on mopeds
Vodka shots and charcoal fires
Palm trees, heat on the asphalt
Larks and lizards and wasps in the grass
Asleep in the dunes and empty pools
Old men in old village squares
Forever playing cards
Pickpockets and Burger King
Empty beaches, skinny dipping
Short dresses, widows on benches
Girls spending their time watching the lifeguards
All day hitchhiking
Beach music and bodysurfing
Open car windows and fights in bars
All for one and one for all
Stray dogs, fans turning
All dressed up for the dance
Getting dry with sandy towels
Sunglasses and cigarettes
Stealing food from empty tables
Every day like the rest
But no day like the last
