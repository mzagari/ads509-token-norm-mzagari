"My Boy" lyrics
R Plus & Dido Lyrics
"My Boy"
Love? What is love?
Well, I suppose, to me it's like, incredible
Completely different from everything I ever felt
And also the difference is also between the last lust and the love
Like, for instance, I can lust very strongly
For a very, very long time
But it's not the same as when I feel real love
Real love is so deep it can make you sick
And hurt your tummy
And sometimes even make you so sad you want to die
But also it can make you so excited
It's like you took drugs
And it's so exciting you never want to eat
Or sleep
My boy
He ain't up to much
My boy
He ain't into love
My boy
He don't get all dressed up
He don't get a second glance
My boy
His head is in the clouds
He just leaves it all to chance
But when he calls
I always say
Come on over
We can dance
(Oh) we can dance
(Oh) we can dance
(Oh) we can dance
My boy
He ain't up to much
My boy
He ain't into love
My boy
He don't get all dressed up
He don't get a second glance
But when he calls
I always say
Come on over
We can dance
(Oh) we can dance
(Oh) we can dance
(Oh) we can dance
(Oh) we can dance
(Oh) we can dance
We can dance
(Oh) we can dance
We can dance
