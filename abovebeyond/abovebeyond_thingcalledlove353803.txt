"Thing Called Love" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Thing Called Love"
There was a time there was a place
But there was fear inside
A witty line to save my face
A parachute of pride
To cross the line takes a tiny step
But will the spark cause the bridge to burn?
My fear entwined with my regret
I beat a path for safe return
There's a thing called love that we all forget
And it's a wasted love that we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget
Forget about a thing called love
So here we are, we're just the same
And you will never know
My secret plan
How close we came
To share another road
And have I lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside?
Is it just me I'd like to know
Or are we all just a little blind?
There's a thing called love that we all forget
And it's a wasted love that we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget
Forget about a thing called love
