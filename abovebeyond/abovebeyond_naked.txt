"Naked" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Naked"
(feat. Justine Suissa)
I'm turning around to find
I'm just a step behind
Wondering where you've been my whole life
A kiss and then a wave
How long for you say
Wondering where you've been my whole life
And only you can know
Who you are
And only you can change
How you feel
Drop the masquerade
All the lies will fade
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
Sleeping we can learn
I'll sleep walk to the earth
Wondering where I've been my whole life
Love the place you are
Love with all your heart
Know that it's what will make your whole life
And only you can know
Who you are
And only you can change
How you feel
Drop the masquerade
All the lies will fade
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
Let's get naked
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
(With our words, with our ways)
Let's get naked
