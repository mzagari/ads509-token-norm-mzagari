"Gratitude" lyrics
Above & Beyond, anamÄ Lyrics
"Gratitude"
(feat. Marty Longstaff)
My current mood
Is gratitude
There are moments in the day
When I just lose myself in sorrow and forget
How the sky has been much bluer
And my life just so much sweeter since we met
My current mood
Is gratitude
My current mood
Is gratitude
My current mood
Is gratitude
My current mood
Is gratitude
There are moments in the day
When I just lose myself in sorrow and forget
How the sky has been much bluer
And my life just so much sweeter since we met
