"Reverie" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Reverie"
(feat. ZoÃ« Johnston)
You used to bring the smell of rain into my bed
And lie so close to me you could be inside my head
Maybe it's a once in a lifetime kind of thing
To feel the kind of magic that your love brings
Some days it's like a haunting
This cool and empty space
Far above and all around me
When I start to miss your face?
You live in me, my reverie
Don't ever leave
You live in me, my reverie
Don't ever leave me
You live in me, my reverie
Don't ever leave
You live in me, my reverie
Don't ever leave me
You live in me, my reverie
Don't ever leave
You live in me, my reverie
Don't ever leave me
Oh no
