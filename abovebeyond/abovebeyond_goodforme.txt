"Good For Me" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Good For Me"
To be with you is easy
I know you're good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
To feel for you is easy oh baby
I know you're good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, my love
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, oh, love
