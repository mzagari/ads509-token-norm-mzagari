"Another Chance" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Another Chance"
All I ask for is another chance
All I ask for
All I ask for is another chance
All I ask for
I know the time will come
When I will learn to love again
I know the time will come
When I won't hold on to the past
I know the time will come
When I will learn to love again
I know the time will come
When I won't hold on to the past
When I won't hold on to the past
When I won't hold on to the past
Only the brave find hope in a second chance
Only the brave find hope
I know the time will come
When I will learn to love again
I know the time will come
When I won't hold on to the past
When I won't hold on to the past
I know the time will come
When I will learn to love again
I know the time will come
When I won't hold on to the past
I know the time will come
When I will learn to love again
I know the time will come
When I won't hold on to the past
