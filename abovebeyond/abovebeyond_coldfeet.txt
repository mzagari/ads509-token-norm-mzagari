"Cold Feet" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Cold Feet"
(feat. Justine Suissa)
You came with your troubled eyes
Oh and the push and pull of loves desires
You came with your easy smile
Oh and your pretty words like coloured birds fly away
I don't want to burn for you
I don't want to yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat
But I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet
When you leave you leave no clues
So I reinvent the things you meant
All of this undeclared charade
Keeps me so unsure always wanting more everyday
I don't want to burn for you
I don't want to yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat
(Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet
You stay the same with things you say
A long embrace, you walk away
And now my eyes are full of light
As I pretend that it's okay
I don't want to burn for you
I don't want to yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat
(Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet
I don't want to burn for you
(I don't want to burn for you)
I don't want to yearn for you
I would love to get crazy in your body heat
(Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet
I would love to get crazy in your body heat
(Know that I would lose myself)
But I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet
(Know that I would lose myself)
