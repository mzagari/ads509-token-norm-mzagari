"See The End" lyrics
Above & Beyond, Seven Lions & Opposite The Other Lyrics
"See The End"
I'm ready now
To figure out
The reason
The more that I lose myself, the more that I find you
I never seem
To remedy
The feeling
When I wanna hide away, you've already found me
In the night
A mighty low
You're all I have
You're all I know
I'll shut my eyes
And hold you close
You're all I've needed
I never wanna see the end
I'm caught in a dream again
In the night
A mighty low
You're all I have
You're all I know
I'll shut my eyes
And hold you close
You're all I've needed
I never wanna see the end
I'm caught in a dream again
In the night
A mighty low
You're all I have
You're all I know
I'll shut my eyes
And hold you close
You're all I've needed
I never wanna see the end
I'm caught in a dream again
In the night
A mighty low
You're all I have
You're all I know
I'll shut my eyes
And hold you close
You're all I've needed
I never wanna see the end
