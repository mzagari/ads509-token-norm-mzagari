"Tightrope" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Tightrope"
When you're running out of tightrope
And there's empty sky below
Where'd you go?
Please. Does anyone know?
When you're running out of tightrope
And the fear begins to grow
Where'd you go?
Please. Does anyone know?
Does anyone know
Does anyone know
Does anyone know, please
Does anyone know
When you've laid down all your aces
And there's nothing left to show
Where'd you go?
Please. Does anyone know?
When you can't shut out the voices
And your head's about to blow
Where'd you go?
Please. Does anyone know?
Does anyone know
Does anyone know
Does anyone know, please
Does anyone know
When you're running out of tightrope
And there's empty sky below
Where'd you go?
Please. Does anyone know?
