"Always" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Always"
(feat. ZoÃ« Johnston)
Maybe, when I am hurting
Maybe you will give a little time to me
And some day, when I really need you
You will take me in your arms and you will say
Always, sure as the rising sun
Always, mornings begun
Always, the way that all good things come
Always, always
Can you hear me when I am way down here
Maybe you will one day walk away from me
Stay close when the wind is howling
And never let me go
Always, sure as the rising sun
Always, mornings begun
Always, the way that all good things come
Always, always
Always, sure as the rising sun
Always, mornings begun
Always, all good things come
Always, always
Maybe one day you'll walk away, one day you'll walk away from me
Maybe you'll be there for me, you'll be there for me, you'll be there for me
Always, sure as the rising sun
Always, mornings begun
Always, the way that all good things come
Always, always
