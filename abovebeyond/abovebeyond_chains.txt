"Chains" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Chains"
(feat. Marty Longstaff)
I think I've lost my chains
I think you've lost your hold on me
The bridle and the reins
The grey clouds that rain cold on me
There is nothing to fear
Jump and the net will appear
I think I've lost my chains
I think I've killed the light on you
No doubt or fear remains
I see my life in spite of you
No, there is nothing to fear
Jump and the net will appear
Now that I feel that weight on my shoulder
I know that I'm stronger, a cloud, not a boulder
The power I feel just fills me with wonder
I've found the way out now, it's over, not under
I think I've lost my chains
Now that I feel that weight on my shoulder
I know that I'm stronger, a cloud, not a boulder
The power I feel just fills me with wonder
I've found the way out now, it's over, not under
I think I've lost my chains
No doubt or fear remains
