"Almost Home" lyrics
Above & Beyond, Justine Suissa Lyrics
"Almost Home"
I am where I am
Because I made it so
I have ways to deceive myself
And bind my soul
I was waiting to be found
But found that on my own
If I looked for the truth
It led me home
My own journey with my own mistakes
The way out is the way in
Just rearrange the things you know
The way out is the way in
The trail will guide you back again
The way out is the way in
And now I'm almost home
The way out is the way in
Some say where you are
Is where you're meant to be
That the lessons always find u
'Till you learn to see
I need to build a little speed
I need to roll this stone
Travel light, know I'm free
But not alone
My own journey with my own mistakes
I talked so much that I couldn't hear you
My eyes were closed
As I looked for a way through
I talked so much that I couldn't hear you
I wasted time with conclusions that I drew
I talked so much that I couldn't hear you
My eyes were closed as I looked for a way through
I talked so much that I couldn't hear you
I wasted time with conclusions that I drew
The way out is the way in
The way out is the way in
And now I'm almost home
The way out is the way in
Just rearrange the things you know
The way out is the way in
The trail will guide you back again
The way out is the way in
And now I'm almost home
The way out is the way in
