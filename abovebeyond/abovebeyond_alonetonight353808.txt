"Alone Tonight" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Alone Tonight"
Slipping sideways, silver stars collide
And fade away just like our love that died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide
From you tonight
I've wrestled with angels all my life
It's always the haloes and the wings
That keep you blind
And if I'd fought with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here
Alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
Alone tonight, just like the western star I'm sinking
The angels curse me blind with
Straight and crooked thinking
I've been crossing out the words I left unsaid
From the epilogue left lying in my head
Where there is poetry and tragedy unread
Until tonight
There's no other angel quite like you
They broke the mould, a thousand pieces icy blue
And though I tried to realign them - like I do
You went your own way
And I did too
So here I am
Alone tonight, just like the western star I'm sinking
The angels curse me blind with
Straight and crooked thinking
