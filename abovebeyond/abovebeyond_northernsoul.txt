"Northern Soul" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Northern Soul"
Midnight, moonlight
The wind blows off Saint Clair
I'm stuck at a red light, waiting
At 6 Mile & Delaware
The sound of a distant Firebird
The echo of a rhyme - Smokey's words
And absence, sweet absence
Fills the freezing air
I've been wayside for years now
But no one seems to care
Their eyes on the distant horizon
I drove them out of here
I gave you the American dream
And the music for your movie scene
But you left me, bleeding
So listen to my prayer
You can break my heart and crush my dreams
But you can never take my soul
You can crack my stones and melt my steel
But you can never take my soul
You can break my heart and crush my dreams
But you can never take my soul
You can crack my stones and melt my steel
But you can never take my soul
You can never take my soul
You can never take my soul
You can never take my soul
Mmm, you can never take my soul
You can never take my soul
You can never take my soul
You can break my heart and crush my dreams
But you can never take my soul
You can crack my stones and melt my steel
But you can never take my soul
You can break my heart and crush my dreams
But you can never take my soul
You can crack my stones and melt my steel
But you can never take my soul
