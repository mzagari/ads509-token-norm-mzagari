Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Happiness Amplified"
(feat. Richard Bedford)
I tried to take a picture
Of the sunlight in your hand
But the tears in my eyes
Make it hard to focus
So I just stand and stare
Through the tears in my eyes
This is the love of my life right here
This is the end of my night of fear
This is the meaning of ever and ever
This is happiness amplified
This is reality starry-eyed
This is the meaning of ever and ever
I came in search of answers
To questions I can't find
But you answered them somehow
Poetry in motion
A melody to find
There's a song in my heart now
This is the love of my life right here
This is the end of my night of fear
This is the meaning of ever and ever
This is happiness amplified
This is reality starry-eyed
This is the meaning of ever and ever
This is the love of my life right here
This is the end of my night of fear
This is the meaning of ever and ever
This is happiness amplified
This is reality starry-eyed
This is the meaning of ever and ever
