Above & Beyond Lyrics
"My Own Hymn (Alpha 9 Remix)"
(feat. ZoÃ« Johnston)
In the confines of a photograph
Lives a child who once was me
Oh, do you see?
I still see through those eyes
Why did you choose to believe bare-faced lies
And let the troubles of others darken your skies?
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says, "Uh, your soul is good"
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says "Yes, your soul is good"
"Your soul is good"
In the remnants of our time
I wake to find you've broken me
Used to be free
But in pain I chose to stay
Why did you choose to believe things unkind?
Oh, hallelujah!
Heaven is in your mind
Oh, yeah
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says, "Uh, your soul is good"
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says "Yes, your soul is good"
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
Oh, yeah
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says, "Uh, your soul is good"
I wrote my own hymn
I sing my own hymn
It says "Yes, your soul is good"
