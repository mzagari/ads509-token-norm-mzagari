"Sun & Moon" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Sun & Moon"
It's raining, it's pouring
A black sky is falling
It's cold tonight
You gave me your answer - goodbye
Now I'm all on my own tonight
But when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win
We were in heaven, you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you
You'll never get over me
You held back and lost out
You gave in to each doubt
And walked away
A final embrace
You won't turn, I won't chase
Nothing more to say
But when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win
We were in heaven, you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you
You'll never get over me
