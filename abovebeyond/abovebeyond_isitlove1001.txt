Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Is It Love? (1001)"
Is it love
If we can talk about it?
Is it love
If you don't feel the same?
Is it love
If we can talk about it?
Is it love
If you don't feel the same?
Is it love?
Is it love?
Is it love?
And I know
There's a thousand ways up
For I know
There's a thousand ways up
It's the same way down
There's a thousand ways up
For I know
There's a thousand ways up
It's the same way down
It's the same way down
It's the same way down
And I know
There's a thousand ways up
For I know
There's a thousand ways up
It's the same way down
It's the same way down
