Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Flying By Candlelight"
(feat. Marty Longstaff)
You're my candle in a darkened house
You say relax, I'll lead the way
Up the staircase in this darkened house
Out through the window we're away
You're my candle in a darkened house
You say relax, I'll lead the way
Up the staircase in this darkened house
Out through the window we're away
I've waited a lifetime these night wings to fly
The lights of the city below
Too cold in the dark was my lonely goodbye
But now there's a new light I know
You keep burning, burning bright
(Forever and ever and ever...)
You keep burning, burning bright
(Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...)
You keep burning, burning bright
You keep burning, burning bright
You keep burning, burning bright
(Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...)
You keep burning, burning bright
(Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever...)
You keep burning, burning bright
(Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever...)
You're my candle in a darkened house
