Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Bittersweet & Blue"
(feat. Richard Bedford)
I've got a photograph of you
Kept in a box of memories
And when I feel breakable
I take it out and look into your eyes
Hoping you'd tell me what to do
Give me some guidance
Always unshakeable
Your voice was strong, and beautiful and wise
Look at the cloudless day
You captured me smiling
A fantasy life, you say
Is our silver lining
This is your life
Dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
This is your life
Dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Oh, oh
Bittersweet and blue
Maybe I left it late to say
You were my hero
Rising the falling sun
Whistling Elvis, striding through the snow
The thought of a weekend far away
Lasting forever
But when the day had come
The final bell concealed a body blow
Look at me now, you'd say
Drowning in sorrow
I guess I got lost today
But there's always tomorrow
This is your life
Dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
This is your life
Dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
This is your life
Bittersweet and blue
This is your life
Dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
This is your life
Dreams can come true
But like your memories of me
They'll be bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Bittersweet and blue
Ooh
Bittersweet and blue
