Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Sticky Fingers (Acoustic Version)"
We painted the picture you want
I wanted it too
But now there's something that I
Would like you to do
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
I'm sure I imagine the time
When I have to go
But your small kept disguise
How deep it could go
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
It's not that I'm ungrateful for
The chance to dream and then explore
But your elegant dinosaur limbs
Are still willfully bruising my skin
In such a moment of calm
As rare as it's true
I must admit to myself
What I'm unable to do
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
(Get your sticky fingers out of my head)
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
(Get your sticky fingers out of my head)
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
(Get your sticky fingers out of my head)
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
(Get your sticky fingers out of my head)
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
(Get your sticky fingers out of my head)
Get your sticky fingers out of my head
(Get your sticky fingers out of my head)
