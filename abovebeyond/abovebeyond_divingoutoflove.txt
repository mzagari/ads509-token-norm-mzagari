"Diving Out Of Love" lyrics
Above & Beyond Lyrics
"Diving Out Of Love"
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
Waiting for the day that never came
Lost inside your little world of blame
Tryna find a way to change the frame
But it's never gonna be the same again
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
I keep diving, diving, diving out of love
